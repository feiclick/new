Rename Email to Personal Email in registration forms
As an Event Staff member, I want to ensure that Event Attendees provide their personal email addresses so that I can better stay in touch with them at events


The label 'Email' must be changed to 'Personal Email' on all ANG Event Registration forms that provide this field
The label change will be present in the Edit Event -> RegistrationÂ screens
The label change will be present for all events (historical and new events)

Aggregated Registration Report (NOT applicable)
